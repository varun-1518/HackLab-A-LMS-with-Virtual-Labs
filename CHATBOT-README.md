# Cybersecurity AI Chatbot Integration

This document provides instructions for setting up and using the Gemini-powered cybersecurity chatbot in the Learning Management System.

## Overview

The chatbot uses Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model to provide specialized cybersecurity assistance to users. It can answer questions about security best practices, explain security concepts, offer advice on security issues, and more.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get a Gemini API Key

1. Go to the [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/) and sign in with your Google account
2. Navigate to the API keys section
3. Create a new API key and copy it

### 2. Configure the Backend

1. Open `backend/src/main/resources/application.properties`
2. Replace `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual Gemini API key:
   ```properties
   gemini.api.key=YOUR_ACTUAL_KEY_HERE
   ```

### 3. Start the Application

1. Start the backend Spring Boot application
2. Start the frontend React application
3. The chatbot is now available on all pages of the application

## Using the Chatbot

1. The chatbot appears as a floating button in the bottom right corner of all pages
2. Click the button to open the chat interface
3. Type your cybersecurity question and press Enter or click the send button
4. The AI will respond with relevant cybersecurity information

## Example Questions

Here are some examples of questions you can ask the chatbot:

- "What are the best practices for creating a strong password?"
- "How can I protect my personal data online?"
- "What is a VPN and why should I use one?"
- "How do I recognize a phishing attempt?"
- "What security measures should I implement for my web application?"
- "Can you explain what XSS attacks are?"
- "How do I secure my home Wi-Fi network?"

## Limitations

- The chatbot is specifically trained to answer cybersecurity questions. For other topics, it will politely redirect the conversation back to security topics.
- Responses are generated by an AI model and should be verified for critical security implementations.
- The chatbot works best with clear, specific questions about cybersecurity topics.

## Troubleshooting

If the chatbot is not responding:

1. Check that your Gemini API key is correctly set in the application.properties file
2. Ensure both the frontend and backend applications are running
3. Check the browser console and server logs for any error messages
4. Verify that your API key has not expired and has sufficient quota
